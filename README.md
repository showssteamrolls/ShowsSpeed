# ShowsSpeed
Exploring all things F1 through data science! Documenting my journey in:
- scraping lap-by-lap telemetry
- exploratory data analysis
- engineering new features
- building models that predict lap times and pit stop strategies.
- 2 Polished ML Models:
  - Lap Time Predictor model (baseline → ML variants)
  - Pit Stop Strategist (classify best windows/strategies)
