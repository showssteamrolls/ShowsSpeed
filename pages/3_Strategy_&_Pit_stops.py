- Question: which constructors have the quickest and most consistent pit crews?  
- Approach: timed every pit stop from 2022‚Äì2025, comparing fastest, mean, and median.  
- Why median/mean? Pit times often skewed by botched stops ‚Äî median gives stable benchmark.

st.markdown("### Key Takeaways")
st.markdown("""
- Ferrari, Red Bull, and Williams regularly top pit speed across years.

- Median line helps cut through noise and show sustainable performance.

    - Data: pit stop times logged in FastF1 (2022‚Äì2025).
